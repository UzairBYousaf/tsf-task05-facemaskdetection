# tsf-task05-facemaskdetection

This was my fifth task as a Computer Vision & IoT intern at The Sparks Foundation, here in this task I was told to implement a Face Mask Detection System, that would recognize whether a person was wearing a mask or not. I implemented this using a Resnet10 Caffe Model that was already pretrained on 2.56TB of Face Detection data, however I changed the bottom dense layer to give a binary classification output. The dataset can be downloaded from this link:https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1USHPMzjk3qBdJ2Hdld4otHa8RoK8ki0m?usp=sharing

Moreover a video demonstration this code can be seen at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJPwnBPMVpk

Please feel free to evaluate my effort or ask any questions.
